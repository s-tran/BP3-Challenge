# BP3-Challenge; Stephen Tran
-This problem solution takes advantage of previously knowing the format of the file being read.
-The functions all display an answer on the prompt, specific to which function used.
-It is up to the user to free the memory allocated for their created strings. Other memory allocations are freed after use in each function.
-Dates are assumed to include time and are used like so: "2015-02-22T22:24:56Z" = "20150222222456".
-InstanceIds are assumed to always be 3 characters long.
-Task Names are assumed to be no longer than 50 characters long.
-More detail for use of functions are included in functions and in main of the program.

Functions:

void opencloseTasksDate(String date) {
  iterative approach to find string of letters wanted and then manipulating the pointer to be able to compare the dates as necessary and increment relevant counters
}

void countTasksinRange(String startDate, String endDate) {
  iterative approach to find string of letters wanted and then manipulating the pointer to be able to compare the dates as necessary and increment relevant counters
}

void mostRecentTask(String instanceId) {
  iterative approach to find string of letters wanted and then manipulating the pointer to be able to compare the dates as necessary and update the name of the most recent task
}

void countTasksId(String instanceId) {
  iterative approach to find string of letters wanted and then manipulating the pointer to be able to compare the dates as necessary and increment relevant counters
}
