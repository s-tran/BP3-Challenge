This problem solution takes advantage of previously knowing the format of the file being read.

void opencloseTasksDate(String year, String month, String day) {
  iterative approach to find string of letters wanted and then manipulating the pointer to be able to compare the dates
  (in yyyy, mm, dd format as arguments)
  (assumes open relates to createDate and that date does not include time of day)

void countTasksinRange(String s_year, String s_month, String s_day, String e_year, String e_month, String e_day) {
  iterative approach to find string of letters wanted and then manipulating the pointer to be able to compare the dates
  s_year/month/day are the start values; e_year/month/day are the end values; compares for within that range
  (assumes open relates to createDate and that date does not include time of day)

void mostRecentTask(String instanceId) {

void countTasksId(String instanceId) {
